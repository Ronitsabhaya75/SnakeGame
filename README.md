# SnakeGame

## Introduction
Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a simple console-based game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats fruits. 
The objective is to grow the snake as long as possible without colliding with the walls or itself.

## How to Play
1. Use the 'w', 's', 'a', and 'd' keys to control the snake's movement:

    'w': Move the snake up

    's': Move the snake down

    'a': Move the snake left

    'd': Move the snake right

2. During the game, you will be asked math and relational questions. Answering them correctly will increase your score and snake length.

3. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body. Colliding with any of these will end the game.
